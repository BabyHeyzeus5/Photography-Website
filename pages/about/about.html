                    <p class="description">My passion for photography began in high school, inspired by my mom's Canon camera. She would capture countless moments
                         of my brothers and me during various activities growing up. As I looked through these cherished memories, I felt a growing desire to create my own.

                    <p class="description">I soon found myself using her Canon in a similar fashion, volunteering to photograph robotics tournaments, events at my alma mater,
                         and activities for my nonprofit. This experience deepened my appreciation for the art of photography. It was around this time that I began bringing my 
                         camera everywhere, eager to capture every moment.

                <p>My film camera of choice at the moment is the <em>Canon EOS Rebel XS</em>. I picked up this camera in the summer of 2024 to delve deeper into film photography, 
                    and I’m absolutely thrilled with it. Originally introduced in the 90s, it’s a classic counterpart to the digital cameras I use. The Rebel XS features autofocus 
                    and programmable exposure modes, making it a smooth transition for me between shooting with my R10 and this film camera. Its compatibility with EF lenses also allows 
                    me to easily switch lenses between my film and digital setups.
